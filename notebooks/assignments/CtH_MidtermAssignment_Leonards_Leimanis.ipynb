    "The British singer Gary Numan is often regarded as a pioneer of electronic music, debuting as a solo artist in 1979 with [The Pleasure Principle](https://open.spotify.com/album/6wHjdKs7VVPVcqaHRzwqJt), an album that reached the top of the UK Albums Chart. The song \"Cars\" from this album became a worldwide hit. The album is notable for relying heavily on synthesizers, with no electric guitar, yet having a rock structure. Befitting of this futuristic-at-the-time sound, the lyrics cover science fiction themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, Gary Numan has changed his style and sound several times, but he is still releasing albums which are well regarded and are considered to have a contemporary sound. It would be interesting to see how much an artist's lyrics change over such a long timespan of about 40 years. In this assignment, we will explore the lyrics of the 1979 album The Pleasure Principle and of his 2017 album, [Savage](https://open.spotify.com/album/2d98ICB4Uin8lszUnnCwxo), which again covers science fiction themes.\n",
