    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will investigate the phenomenon of \"*Brand Twitter*\". While corporate communication is traditionally rather bland, in recent years a trend has emerged of brands communicating on social media in a far less formal way. Social media teams of certain brands have started use memes, edgy humour and an informal and personal style of writing, sometimes also engaging with other brand accounts in a way that is similar to how many Twitter users tweet and interact with each other. This phenomenon of corporate personhood has been called *Brand Twitter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, Vulture published a history of the phenomenon, just in case you find it interesting: https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/brand-twitter-jokes-history.html\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will consider a group of brand accounts that are often considered part of *Brand Twitter*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * @Wendys - Wendy's\n",
    "    * @PrimeVideo - Amazon Prime Video\n",
    "    * @MerriamWebster - Merriam Webster\n",
    "    * @BurgerKing - Burger King\n",
    "    * @Netflix - Netflix US\n",
    "    * @McDonalds - McDonald's\n",
    "    * @DennysDiner - Denny's Diner\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought it would be interesting to analyse the tweets of these brand accounts to learn more about this novel style of corporate communication and the ways corporations might be perceived as relatable people on social media."

Let us define a \"First Person Pronoun Ratio\" - the total number of times that the word \"I\" is used by a brand / the total number of times the words \"I\" or \"we\" are used by a brand. This should give us a value between 0 and 1, and a higher value indicates that the brand used the word \"I\" relatively more often compared to the word \"we\". If we multiply this value by 100, it becomes a percentage.\n",
